## Introduction
- SOLID is an acronym representing five essential principles of object oriented programming and design that promote maintainable, scalable and robust software. 

## Explanation

**Single Repository Principle (SRP)** : SRP states that a class, module or function should have only one reason to change, effectively limiting it to one responsiblity. By adhering to SRP, you can create code that it easier to understand, test and maintain. In golang, SRP can be applied to both packages and functions, improving the cohesion and maintainability of your code.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** 

    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
