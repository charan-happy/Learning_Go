## Introduction to HTTP and APIs in Golang
- HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a widely used application-layer protocol that facilitates communication between clients and servers on the internet. In Golang, we can create HTTP servers and clients to build APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow different applications to communicate and exchange data

- APIs are essential in modern software development, enabling developers to create reusable and modular software components. Golang, with its robust standard library and excellent performance, is an excellent choice for building APIs

## Using Golang’s standard libraries for HTTP servers and clients
- Golang's standard library includes the `net/http` package, which provides all the necessary functionality to create HTTP Servers and clients. This package makes it easy to build APIs without relying on external dependencies.

**HTTP Server**
- To create an HTTP Server in Golang, you can use the `http.ListenAndServe()` function. This function takes two parameters: the server's address(including the port number) and the handler that defines how the server responds to incoming request. The handler can be an instance of the `http.Handler` interface or a function with the signature `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)`

Example of an HTTP Server that listens on port 8080 :

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, world!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Http Client:**
- the net/http package also provides the `http.Client` type for creating HTTP clients. The `http.Client` allows you to send HTTP Request to other servers and handle their responses. you can use the http.Get(), http.Post(), and other methods for different HTTP methods.

Example of an HTTP client making a GET request :

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
)
func main() {
    resp, err := http.Get("http://example.com")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Response:", string(body))
}
```
## Understanding multiplexers in Golang
- A Multiplexer, often referred to as "mux" or "router" is responsible for routing incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handler based on the request data like HTTP methods and URL paths. Golang's standard library provides a default multiplexer called `http.ServeMux` which is an implementation of the `http.Handler` interface
- `http.ServeMux` allows you to register patterns for the URL paths and associate them with specific handler functions. It automatically matches incoming requests to the most specific registered pattern and calls the corresponding handler

Example of using `http.ServeMux`:

```go
package main 
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)
func main() {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFun("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!")
    })
    mux.HandleFunc("/greet", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Greetings from your custom API!")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux)
}
```
