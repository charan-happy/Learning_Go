Taking input from the user:

```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"strings"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println("Please enter your name.. ")
var name string
fmt.Scanln(&name)
name = strings.TrimSpace(name)
fmt.Printf("Hi, %s !, I'm ready to GO !")
}

```
- save the program as `user-input.go`  and run as `go run user-input.go`
  
-  The fmt.Scanln method tells the computer to wait for input from the
 keyboard ending with a new line or (\n), character. This pauses the
 program, allowing the user to enter any text they want
-  To use the strings package you need to import it at the top of the
 program
- The fmt.Printf function takes a string, and using
 special printing verbs, (%s), it injects the value of name into the string.
 You do this because Go does not support string interpolation, which would
 let you take the value assigned to a variable and place it inside of a string.

- the TrimSpace function, from Goâ€™s standard library
 strings package, on the string that you captured with fmt.Scanln.
 The strings.TrimSpace function removes any space characters,
 including new lines, from the start and end of a string.
