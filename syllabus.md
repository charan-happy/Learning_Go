Why Should I Learn Go?
We like you already. Asking those smart, tough questions!

Thankfully Jayson wrote a post dedicated to answering this question but here's the top 5 reasons why you should learn Go:

First Class Concurrency. Translation: handles massive workloads easily
Exceptional Performance. Translation: fast like an F1 car
Simplicity & Familiarity. Translation: easy to learn and use ðŸ™‚
Package Manager. Translation: makes your life easy
Proven Track Record. Translation: popular with major companies with over 20,000 Go jobs available
Read Jayson's post if you want to go deeper and see why these 5 things matter.

Ultimately, Go was created by Google to solve Google-sized problems. This has made it very popular with many companies solving massive scaling challenges. It's also one of the fastest growing programming languages released in the last ten years.

These factors = great job prospects.

There are 20,000+ job postings listed for Go programmers and their average salary of 8305614.40â‚¹ / year.

So if you are looking for something:

That's easy to learn
With lots of job demand
And can provide generous compensation
Then learning Go is a great option for you to consider.

Here's what this Golang course covers:
This course, like all Zero To Mastery courses, will aso be constantly updated as the landscape changes.

As the Go ecosystem evolves, this course will also be continually updated with lectures and resources. This will be your go-to place to find the latest Go best practices and resources anytime in the future.

1. GOLANG FUNDAMENTALS - You'll be introduced to the Golang programming language and its sought-after capabilities, specifically its ease of use as well as its efficient code-compilation and execution.

What are Golang variables and functions?
What is a Golang for loop?
What are platforms?
These are the types of questions that'll be answered along with lots of demos and exercises for you to practice along the way.

2. PROGRAMMING BASICS WITH GO - The goal of this section is to get you up to speed on Go programming. You've got to drill down into the basics before you can get to mastery!

So you'll be learning how to master concepts such as pointers, memory, and concurrency that you'll be able to apply in the rest of the course and in your Master Project, an enterprise-level Pixl art editor.

3. PACKAGES & MODULES - Packages are Go's way of organizing code, while modules are a collection of packages. You'll encounter these as soon as you start coding in Go, so it's important to explore them in-depth and have an understanding of how they work.

4. DATA TYPES - You'll take the next step of working with Golang by learning everything there is to know about data types, which create an extensive system used for declaring variables and functions of different types.

5. STRUCTURES, ARRAYS, SLICES, MAPS, POINTERS - These are vital pieces of the puzzle for you to become a Go programming master. For example, structures allow data to be stored in groups, similar to a 'class' in other programming languages.

Meanwhile Golang maps are a commonly used (+ powerful, ingenious, and versatile!) data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. You'll learn all about these (and more!) while solidifying your knowledge with exercises and demos.

6. TESTING - It's important to test software to prevent regressions and ensure it meets specifications. To accomplish this there's two primary of methods of testing: unit testing and integration testing.

You'll learn about test tables and examples of test code, and by the end you'll understand exactly how to set up your tests.

7. INTERFACES - Interfaces allow us to specify the behavior of a type instead of the type itself. This allows functions to operate on more than one type of data. You'll fully understand why and how interfaces are implicitly implemented.

8. ERROR HANDLING - Go has no exceptions. Instead, errors are returned as the last returned value from a function. This encodes the failure of a function as part of the function signature itself.

You'll learn exactly why and how this makes it simple to determine if a function can fail in Go so that you can write and deploy perfect code.

9. CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING - Generally code executes line-by-line. But when you have concurrency, you're allowed to execute multiple lines at a time. Concurrent code can get messy pretty quickly, but one of the great things about Go is that it automatically chooses between the different types of concurrent programming. You'll learn exactly how to use that to your advantage.

10. BUILDING PROFESSIONAL PROJECTS WITH GO - You'll be using your Go knowledge to create an enterprise-level Pixl Art editor as your Final Project.

You'll apply all you've learned about pointers, function literals, closures, modules, packages, and interfaces to help solidify your Golang knowledge while buidling something awesome at the same time.

And it's sure to impress anyone looking at your portfolio.

Note: All code for the Pixl Art project (+ all projects and exercises) is provided step-by-step. So even if you donâ€™t like to code along, you will get access to all the code, exercises, and projects we build right away.
