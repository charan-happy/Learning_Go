Why Should I Learn Go?
 
 Here's the top 5 reasons why you should learn Go:

First Class Concurrency. Translation: handles massive workloads easily  
Exceptional Performance. Translation: fast like an F1 car  
Simplicity & Familiarity. Translation: easy to learn and use ðŸ™‚  
Package Manager. Translation: makes your life easy  
Proven Track Record. Translation: popular with major companies with over 20,000 Go jobs available  


<details><summary>PROGRAMMING BASICS WITH GO</summary> - The goal of this section is to get you up to speed on Go programming. You've got to drill down into the basics before you can get to mastery!

So you'll be learning how to master concepts such as pointers, memory, and concurrency </details>

<details><summary>PACKAGES & MODULES</summary> - Packages are Go's way of organizing code, while modules are a collection of packages. You'll encounter these as soon as you start coding in Go, so it's important to explore them in-depth and have an understanding of how they work.</details>

<details><summary>DATA TYPES </summary>- You'll take the next step of working with Golang by learning everything there is to know about data types, which create an extensive system used for declaring variables and functions of different types.</details>

<details><summary>STRUCTURES, ARRAYS, SLICES, MAPS, POINTERS </summary> - These are vital pieces of the puzzle for you to become a Go programming master. For example, structures allow data to be stored in groups, similar to a 'class' in other programming languages.
</details>

<details><summary>TESTING  </summary>- It's important to test software to prevent regressions and ensure it meets specifications. To accomplish this there's two primary of methods of testing: unit testing and integration testing. </details>

<details><summary>INTERFACES </summary> - Interfaces allow us to specify the behavior of a type instead of the type itself. This allows functions to operate on more than one type of data. You'll fully understand why and how interfaces are implicitly implemented.</details>

<details><summary>ERROR HANDLING </summary>- Go has no exceptions. Instead, errors are returned as the last returned value from a function. This encodes the failure of a function as part of the function signature itself.</details>

<details><summary>CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING </summary>- Generally code executes line-by-line. But when you have concurrency, you're allowed to execute multiple lines at a time. Concurrent code can get messy pretty quickly, but one of the great things about Go is that it automatically chooses between the different types of concurrent programming. You'll learn exactly how to use that to your advantage.</details>
