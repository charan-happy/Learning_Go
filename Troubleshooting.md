  The error message `hello-world.go:1:1: expected 'package', found 'EOF'` typically occurs in Go when the compiler can't find a package declaration. Here are some common reasons and solutions:

1. **File Not Saved**: Ensure that you've saved your `.go` file before compiling. If you're using an editor, hit `Cmd+S` (or `Ctrl+S` on Windows/Linux) to save the file. Sometimes, this error occurs because the file hasn't been saved yet³.

2. **Missing Package Declaration**: Make sure your `.go` file starts with a package declaration. For example:
    ```go
    package main
    import "fmt"
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
    }
    ```
    The `package main` line is essential for Go files. If it's missing, you'll encounter the `expected 'package', found 'EOF'` error⁴.

3. **Check Imports**: If your code relies on other packages, ensure that you've imported them correctly. Verify that the necessary imports are present and spelled correctly.

4. **Syntax Errors**: Look for any syntax errors in your code. Sometimes a missing semicolon or other syntax issue can lead to this error.

Remember to save your file and check the package declaration. If the issue persists, review your code for any other potential errors. 😊👍
